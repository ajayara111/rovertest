Rover Solution in JAVA
------------------------

Assumption:
-----------
It is a simplistic solution which assumes the following 
1) Once rover hits the extreme it won't move and it will wait for next instruction 
2) 0,0 is the base cooridinate - can not go negative on the x and y coordinates 


Solution:
--------
As this solution if for the Rover we have the following base parameters 

 *Geometry 
		* Boundry condition : the extreme at  which the rover can move 
		* Rover Direction : The direction for the rover and future steps 
		* XY coordinates of Rover 
		
 *Exception 
 		*Just now capturing only input errors 
 		
 *Basic Rover 
 	 	* For rover movement
